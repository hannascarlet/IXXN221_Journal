    <h1>IXXN221 Journal - Hanna Scarlet</h1>
    <h4>This journal is a collection of documentation from my weekly learnings from IXXN221 Web Design 2023.</h4>
    <h3>Week 1:</h3>
    <p>
        This week was an intro into the course and a general overview of the assignments and how the course works. It was really nice to get introduced to the lecturer and the tutors and hear a bit about them and their work. They told us that the course has changed and it mostly focuses on design now with a little bit of coding which I am happy about as I am much more interested in the design part of websites rather than coding. The overview of the assignments seemed achievable with three main assignments and weekly quizzes. We did an ice breaker activity which was good to get to know everybody a bit. They also showed us exemplas for all of the assignments which I really liked as usually in classes we just get given one assignment at a time, and so I really liked knowing exactly what was coming in the course. 
        I’m hoping in this course to learn about what actually makes a good and usable website. I feel confident with fonts and colours and the graphic design side of website creation but I am curious how to do things like make an accessible design. This is also the first interaction design paper I have ever taken so I am keen to learn about user experience and how they will interact with my site. For my independent work this week I just thought about what kind of website I want to create, and decided that I want to do an ecommerce store because I am a fashion major this seemed the most useful for me to learn, if one day I want to start a fashion brand and need to make a website to sell it on.

    <h3>Week 2:</h3>
    <p>
        This week we learnt a lot more about assignment 1 which is a research report and learnt about users. For this first assignment we have to create a user persona, a venn diagram, a customer journey map and a user flow which are all things that will help me understand what my user wants and needs and how to design a website to fit those wants and needs. We also have to write a rationale which is good for me as I like explaining my choices with words. I am a little worried about the other things in the assignment though as because I didn’t take the first year interaction course I feel a little lost in what to do but I am excited to try to understand users better. 
        We then learned about the history of web design from 1990-1998. The world wide web started in 1990, and the term user experience was created by Apple employees in 1995. Google started in 1998 and was started as a research project. I found all of this quite interesting as I had no idea about any of the history of the internet or websites and I think as designers it is important to learn about the history of the field you are designing in out of respect for those designers. 
        We then dug a little deeper into what a user persona is and I learnt that it’s about making up a character and then putting yourself in their shoes to better understand a user. It needs to include their demographic, goals, and barriers. We then did a workshop exercise where we created a user persona in groups and I think it was a good exercise to practise how to do it. 
        For my independent work this week I created the user persona for my assignment, which I enjoyed doing. I did a lot of research into creating it and I think that I did quite a good job. The coding lecture this week was about html basics. I’ve never done coding before so I had to watch it quite a few times to wrap my head around it but I think I finally understood it.

    <h3>Week 3:</h3>
    <p>
        This week we continued on with the history of web design but this time from 1998-2008. In 1999 web 2.0 was created which was interactive design rather than static. Wikipedia was brought out in 2001, which is an internet encyclopaedia. The Audi website was the first partially responsive website. MySpace was founded in 2003 which was a social network and then Linkedin in 2004. Youtube in 2005, Twitter in 2006, the first IPhone in 2007,  and Google Chrome in 2008. I liked learning about when these different sites were created as I really had no idea before this. I found the Million Dollar Homepage in 2005 really interesting as people could buy pixels on a page for advertisement. 
        We then dug a little deeper into the venn diagram required for the first assignment and about design goals. We learnt about qualitative, quantitative and smart goals. When designing for this site I have to think about what is the goal of the feature or design element that I am designing and how is it going to impact the user experience. A venn diagram is two overlapping circles to show a relationship between two things. One circle needs to be the designer goals, which is me, and the other circle is about the user goals. In the middle where the circles overlap is about the shared goals. We then did a workshop to reinforce this learning and in groups we created a venn diagram. I find these group workshops really helpful as I am able to get other peoples perspectives and ideas as well as practise the learning with others support. 
        For my independent work this week I created a venn diagram for my assignment. I had my goals as a designer on one side, and my user persona’s goals on the other and then shared goals in the middle. The coding lecture this week was again about html basics and we learnt how to create links which I understood well.

    <h3>Week 4:</h3>
    <p>
        This week we again continued on learning about the history of web design but this time from 2009-now. In 2009, Facebook introduced a like button which indicated a user's positive reaction. In 2010 Google Fonts and Sketch were introduced, and in 2016 was Figma and Adobe XD. It was nice to learn about the history of these sites that I use often. We then dug a little deeper into the customer journey map required for the first assignment. The different parts of the journey map were shown and explained and it does seem quite complicated but I think if I take my time and move through each stage I should be able to figure it out. A customer journey map is used to show how the user would move through your site and the experience and different pain points they might have. By doing this I can better understand what small design choices that I otherwise wouldn’t think too hard about can affect the user. We then also learnt more about the user flow diagram which is also required for assignment 1. This diagram doesn’t seem too complicated with just an entry point, steps to completion and the end point. I do need to take care though what shapes, colours, arrows, and labels I am using to make it consistent and make the different types actions as clear as possible. In project support time in class I received feedback on my user persona and venn diagram. All the feedback was positive on my user persona and my venn diagram just had a couple of things I needed to change.
        For my independent work this week I created my customer journey map for assignment 1. I actually found this quite challenging in trying to think in the shoes of the user and we didn’t have a workshop this week to practise making one with others which I usually find helpful. I managed to create one that I am pretty happy with it but I need to get some feedback on it to make sure I did it right. The coding lecture this week was about CSS box model which is basically making the site look nicer and adding some design elements. I thought this lecture was quite a helpful one and will definitely be using what I learnt from it.

    <h3>Week 5:</h3>
    <p>
        This week the class was quite short as the assignment 1 hand in is soon so they just went over the expected hand in format for that. I got some feedback on my customer journey map and I have been told to add an extra section about the customer evaluating the product and I definitely agree with the feedback and will be adding that section.  For my independent work this week I continued on with my assignment 1 and I created the user flow diagram. At first I misunderstood what we were supposed to do and I just did a section of my customer journey map expanded into the user journey flow but I got some feedback on discord that we are actually supposed to create the whole journey. I created a much larger user flow diagram which took me a long time as it was difficult for me to think of every step someone would take on my site but I think it was a really worthwhile thing to complete because it made me think in detail how to make my site the most user friendly it could be. I also wrote my rationale this week which I enjoyed doing as I liked explaining why I had made the choices that I had but I did find it really hard to keep it to 700 words as I felt like I had a lot of decisions that I wanted to thoroughly explain as well as show my research. 
        The coding lecture this week was part 1 of CSS grids which is about creating a website inside of rows and columns. So far with the coding part of this courseI am struggling a little bit as it's definitely not something that comes naturally to me. I think if I just continue watching the lectures and practising I will start to understand it more.

    <h3>Week 6:</h3>
    <p>
        This week I handed in my assignment 1, which I am really happy with and I feel like I planned my time well and didn’t have to rush it at all. During class this week they went over assignment 2.1 and recapped what was required for it. We have to create wireframes, design iterations, a style guide, a final design prototype and a written rationale. We are supposed to create a minimum of 2 pages for our site but I think for my idea it makes sense to do a few more. We can choose either code or CMS and I think for me for my learning it makes more sense to do CMS because that is more likely to be something I use in the future as I am not going to go into a website creation field so I don’t think coding is so important for me to practise and have in my portfolio. Also I am struggling a lot with the coding and so I don’t want my site design to be worse because of my lack of coding skills. The rest of the class today was really interesting and I learnt a lot. The first topic was about colour and I learnt about the difference between RGB, CMYK, Pantone, and Hexadecimal colours. I then learnt about colour schemes (Monochromatic, analogous and complementary), and the different associations that colours can have. Even though I am nearing the end of my second year doing design, I had never actually been taught colour theory before so it was really helpful. I then learnt about accessibility and how important colour contrast is and how there are lots of checkers for it. We then learnt about typography, about different fonts and sizes and scaling as well as leading and paragraph width which are all really important for web design. 
        We then did a workshop where we had to put all these things we just learnt into practice through critiquing a design. I had never done something like this and I feel like it was quite helpful and I noticed things that I previously wouldn’t have thought were a problem. For my independent work this week I figured out a colour palette using coolors which was a really helpful tool I learnt about in the lecture, as well as I found fonts and started adding them to my style guide.

    <h3>Mid Tri Break:</h3>
    <p>
        For the two weeks over the break there was obviously no new content to learn but I did work on my assignment 2.1. I created all of my wireframes on figma and generated lots of design ideas. I found this quick generation process quite helpful in creating lots of different designs that I can pull ideas from for my final. I also watched back through lots of the coding tutorials to try to understand them better.

    <h3>Week 7:</h3>
    <p>
        This week we learned about composition and how using grids can help you achieve a good balanced composition. We also learned about the importance of visual hierarchy, scale, white space, and balance in web design. Next we learned about affordances and how mental models make users expect the same thing on every website and so the icons, call to actions, buttons, links, and input fields are important to be consistent with other sites and in the way the user would expect them. We then had a recap of assignment 2.1 as it is due next week. I received some project support for my wireframes and it was all positive feedback so nothing I need to change there. There was no workshop or coding lecture this week. For my independent work this week I continued working on my assignment 2.1. I completed my design iterations and my style guide. I found the iterations more fun than the wireframes as I was able to play around with colours and fonts and images. Creating lots of different outcomes means I could more easily figure out what I wanted for my final prototype. The style guide will be useful as well to make sure I stick to consistent design throughout my site.

    <h3>Week 8:</h3>
    <p>
        This week I handed in my assignment 2.1. Over the past few days I have been working very hard on finalising my prototype. This assignment was my first time using figma so that was a bit of a learning curve, and it required a lot of time researching how to do things. I wanted my prototype to work as properly as possible so I spent a lot of time figuring out how to get the text in the buttons to change colour when hovering, and get the product image carousel. I am really proud of the site I have created as I feel aesthetically it’s really nice and fresh and it meets my users' wants. I also wrote my rationale which again I struggled to keep it to the word count as I had so much I wanted to explain. In class this week I presented my assignment. I was quite nervous about presenting as I don’t really like public speaking especially on zoom but I feel like I did well. They then went over the assignment 2.2 brief and the differences between the coding and CMS option. I have decided to do the CMS option as I believe it will be more beneficial for me to learn as I will need to learn to code anyway for this journal and otherwise I will have no chance to learn to use CMS. I have decided to use EditorX as that seems to me after some research to be the most commonly used CMS software in the industry. The coding lecture this week was CSS grids part 2 and was all about making a responsive website through grids, meaning if it is resized it won’t be messed up which I think I understood alright.

    <h3>Week 9:</h3>
    <p>
        This week in class we learnt about responsive design and how important it is for web design because a website needs to be able to work on multiple different screens without the design looking broken. It is important to use percentages instead of pixels when designing a site so when the screen changes the elements of the site change to fit it accordingly. We also learned about file organisation and the importance of keeping your files structured. I learned about a site called TinyPNG which I hadn’t heard about and seems really helpful as you can compress files and I often need to do that but I don’t know how. I got a bit of project support today just around what I was thinking for my site. For my independent work this week I just started learning the basics around EditorX through tutorial videos as well as playing around a little with it and trying out some of the different tools. It seems like quite an intuitive software and a little bit similar to figma so I don’t think I should have too much of a problem picking it up. I think learning EditorX will be helpful for my future as a designer as it seems like a good skill to have on my resume and make me more employable. 
    </p>
    <h3>Week 10:</h3>
    <p>
    This week we went over the assignment 2.2 brief and what we will need to hand in in our pdf document. I learned how to publish my CMS website and how to get the link for it. They then talked a bit about this journal and what we need to complete for that. We were given a content overview for the whole course which was really helpful for me as I reread my journal entries and made sure I hadn’t missed out on talking about any of the content. We then got given a blog demo by the tutors and what they had done when they took this course. I found it really helpful seeing what they had done as an example of what I could do. For my independent work this week I did a lot of work on my assignment 2.2 and ended up mostly finishing it on EditorX. I am really happy how it has turned out, the design is basically the exact same as my prototype in assignment 2.1 but I added some effects and I really like how they look. I have made the images move in from the sides and the text boxes fade in as well as the product images fade in one by one. I think it has given the site an elevated feel from my prototype and it feels to me like a site that could actually exist.

    <h3>Week 11:</h3>
    <p>
    Over the past few days I have been working on finalising my assignment 2.2. I put the final touches on my EditorX site and I worked a lot in trying to make it responsive. Unfortunately no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get it to work but I think if I had more time I would try and figure this out more. The site looks the best at 1300px and then gets a bit funny at other sizes. I am really disappointed that I couldn’t get this to work properly as it is a really important part of web design. I also completed my documentation and explained my decisions and how I got to the final product. This week in class all that happened were presentations. I had an appointment in the morning so was unable to make it to the class but I recorded my presentation and handed that in instead. The coding lectures have finished now and overall I am feeling better about my coding ability. At the start I was really struggling with the coding part of this course and didn’t do very well on a lot of the quizzes but I think it helped me a lot to be able to rewatch the lectures many times and absorb more information every time. Unfortunately it is still not something that I enjoy doing and so I can’t see myself having a career in it or continuing to study it more but I think there is value as a designer in having some base understanding of other designers roles. For example if I was ever to design a website to then give to a coder to make, it would be helpful for me to have some basic knowledge of coding so that I can be a bit more understanding and realistic when designing.

    <h3>Week 12:</h3>
    <p>
    This week the journal assignment was talked about a bit as well as an in depth view at all of the course content so far to make sure we haven’t missed anything in our journal entries. We then did a workshop where in groups we had to redesign a website, which was the same website that we critiqued in week 6. It was really good to be able to put our critiques into practice and also develop them from week 6. This week I have been looking back through my journal entries and making sure that I have included all necessary content. I have also been thinking about the design of my coded site. I really enjoy minimalistic design and so I want to do that for my site so that the main focus is on the blog content rather than the site. My overall thoughts about this course is that it has been hard but I have learnt a lot throughout it. My favourite parts of the course were the lectures in week 6 and 7 that were about colour, typography, and composition. They are really important design principles that were great to learn more about especially in the context of web design. I am majoring in fashion design and minoring in communication design so this interaction course was an elective course because I thought it would be interesting and a good thing to have in my portfolio and I ended up really enjoying it. My least favourite part of the course was the coding part, as I really struggled picking it up and I didn’t really enjoy doing it but I think it was a good challenge and a good thing for me to have knowledge on. As far as the assignments in this course I am proud of what I produced, especially the site I created.
